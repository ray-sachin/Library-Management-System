# 📚 Smart Library Management System

### 🎯 Project Objective
To design and implement an advanced, console-based **Smart Library Management System** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in **Java**, integrating features like:
- Book Management (Add, Search, Issue, Return)
- Member Management (Students & Faculty)
- Automated Fine Calculation
- Borrow Tracking with Due Dates

This project uses **Java Collections**, **Date and Time APIs**, and a **menu-driven interface** to simulate real-world library workflows.

## 🧠 Concepts & Technologies Used
- **Java OOP Principles**
  - Abstraction
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
- **Java Collections Framework** (`ArrayList`, `HashMap`)
- **Java Date & Time API** (`LocalDate`, `ChronoUnit`)
- **Console-based User Interface**
- **Exception Handling**
